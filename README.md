<p>This is a basic Pac-Man game built in Python during the project phase in an IT lesson at school. It uses the pre-written <i>graphics_and_games_klassen.py</i> file but is developed using <i>pacman</i>, <i>foodpiece</i>, <i>labyrinth</i>, and <i>main</i> files written entirely by myself.</p>

<br>

<p>Works only on Windows.</p>
